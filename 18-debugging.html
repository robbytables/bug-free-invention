<!--


## Overview
This lesson is meant to give students the skills needed to debug their own code. There is a mix of demo, You Do, and We Do to keep it fresh while running through many common errors. We throw a lot of errors at them very quickly - the idea is to get them comfortable recognizing errors and solving them, not to memorize them.

Then, it guides students in how to use `Try`-`Except` blocks when errors are expected/unavoidable. Last, some time is spent teaching students how to handle situations that are problematic, but don't usually throw errors specifically, including endless loops, off-by-one errors, and logical errors.


#### Helpful Table of Errors

| Error Type  | Most Common Cause |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------|
| AttributeError  | Attempting to access a non-existent attribute |
| KeyError | Attempting to access a non-existent key in a dict |
| ImportError  | A module you tried to import doesn't exist |
| IndexError  | You attempted to access a list element that doesn't exist |
| IndentationError  | Indenting code in an invalid way |
| IOError  | Accessing a file that doesn't exist |
| NameError  | Attempting to use a module you haven't imported/installed |
| OverflowError  | You made a number larger than the maximum size |
| RuntimeError  | The error doesn't fit into any other category |
| SyntaxError  | A typo, such as forgetting a colon |
| TypeError  | Using two different types in an incompatible way |
| ValueError  | When you are trying to convert bad keyboard input to a number |
| ZeroDivisionError  | Dividing By Zero |

## Learning Objectives

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reassure them that this won't be awful: it is not really about their problem solving skills so much at this point as it is about getting them to notice the error message and decode what it is saying.</li>

<h2>Discussion: Error Messages</h2>
<p>Have you found a shiny red error message before? What do you think has happened here?</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start a discussion here. What's going on here? What other errors have the students encountered?</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;How many of you have run your code in a repl.it only to have a bunch of red text pop-up instead of your expected output?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What do you think is going on here in this image? How could it be fixed?&quot;</li>

<section id="making-errors-into-friends" class="level2">
<h2>Making Errors Into Friends</h2>
<p>On the surface, errors are frustrating! However, we'll walk through some common ones. You'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Errors sometimes say exactly what's wrong.</li>
<li>Some errors have very common causes.</li>
<li>Errors may say exactly how to fix the issue.</li>
<li>Python errors are very helpful and have clear messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind - what's the problem with this code?</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ga-instruction/assets/python-fundamentals/ZeroDivisionError.png" />
</figure>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>We introduce ZeroDivisionError first to start discussion, as just about everyone knows that you can't divide by 0. Ask if the students think Python's error message did a good job of informing us of what the issue was.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Python errors sometimes tell you exactly what to change about your code. For example, we see <code>ZeroDivisionError: divide by zero</code>, which is a really clear way to describe the issue.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Compared to other programming languages, Python errors are really nice! Think of them as helpful hints to help you make the best code possible!&quot;</li>

</iframe>
<p><strong>Protip</strong>: Index errors typically happen when you attempt to access a list index that doesn't exist.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a demo, not an exercise!</li>
<li>Teach the students how to read the line number where the error occurred. Remind them that the error often happens on the line <em>above</em> the line that threw the error.</li>
<li>Make sure that students come up with the solution themselves, but ask leading questions. For example, &quot;Obviously this code isn't working, but by looking at it, can you tell what my intention was? Which element do you think I was trying to access?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points: - &quot;Remember that lists are indexed starting at zero!&quot; (maybe show a reminder)</p>

<p>Teaching tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give them just a minute or two; then go over it. This is a new error, but it's an easy one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points: - &quot;Let's go back to an error we encountered earlier today!&quot; - We most commonly get a <code>NameError</code> if we use a variable: * Without defining it. * <em>Before</em> defining it</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching tip:</p>
<ul>
<li>The repl.it is for you to demo this, not for an exercise.</li>
<li>Ask students what they think most commonly causes KeyErrors. Good answers might include case sensitivity in the key names, a typo in the key name, or simply not remembering what keys are available.</li>

<p>Teaching Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>See if they can pick up the answer.</li>
<li>Python is different (and better) than other languages in this regard, but it's important to emphasize that = and == are for different purposes!</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points: - &quot;In any other language, (take JavaScript for example), if you accidentally use a single equals when you mean to use a double equals, the variable would be reassigned while inside that if statement and your 13 year old would be having a beer! Luckily the designers of Python knew this and made the choice to throw an error!&quot;</p>

<p>What do we learn from this error message? Have you learned a way to fix this?</p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Some languages, like JavaScript, let this code run (breaking something!).</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're trying to combine different types in a way that doesn't make sense</li>
<li>The error was caused when using the <code>+</code> operator</li>
<li>The error was caused by two incompatible types: <code>string</code> and <code>integer</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>They learned how to do type conversion in the last lesson, so you could point out that they can cast 10 as an int and then this will work.</li>

<ul>
<li>This isn't an exercise - just code to help you demo.</li>
<li>This is so common for Python beginners, so it is important to get practice recognizing this!</li>
<li>Have students come up with some examples of what might cause an error like this. Answers might include mixing tabs and spaces or indenting too much/too little.</li>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <code>RuntimeError</code> is like if I said to you:</p>
<pre><code>Please eat the piano</code></pre>
<p>You can understand what's being asked, but can't actually do that!</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Unfortunately this is an error that comes up when no other error type fits the situation. You will need to rely heavily on the content of the error message rather than getting much of a hint from the type alone&quot;</li>

<h2>Quick Review</h2>
<p>There are many types of errors in Python!</p>
<p>Usually, the error has a name or description that says exactly what's wrong.</p>
<p>Think about <code>IndentationError</code> or <code>IndexError</code> - what went wrong?</p>
<p>Sometimes, you'll see <code>RuntimeError</code>. Python throws us this if something is broken but it can't say specifically what - like <code>Please eat the piano</code>. Revisit your code and see what might have happened.</p>

<h2>Discussion: Throwing Errors</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we might have code that we expect to throw an error.</p>

<li>This causes a <code>ValueError</code> - we'll be trying to make an int out of a string &quot;Moose&quot;.</li>
<li>We can anticipate and prepare for it!</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by making sure they understand what the code does. They've seen <code>input</code> a few times, but won't officially learn it for three more lessons; they just learned type casting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Sometimes you may expect certain code to throw an error, and you may want to handle that situation with a smooth error message as opposed to having your whole program blow up with red text.&quot;</li>

<section id="try-except" class="level2">
<h2>Try-Except</h2>
<p>A <code>Try</code>-<code>Except</code> block is the way we can catch errors in Python. We can catch:</p>
<ul>
<li>One error (<code>except ValueError:</code>)</li>
<li>Multiple errors (<code>except (ValueError, KeyError):</code>)</li>
<li>Any/every error (<code>except:</code>)</li>

</iframe>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try / except is new; do this with them. Make this a teaching slide, not an exercise.</li>
<li>Demonstrate some example output - strings, ints, floats, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call out that we specifically say &quot;ValueError&quot;, and <code>err</code> is just a random keyword. Change it to demo. Add other error catches; take out the ValueError specifically.</li>
<li>&quot;A Try-Except block is the way we can catch errors in Python.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;We can catch one error (as we see in the code), we can catch multiple errors, or we can just catch any/every error by leaving it blank.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You can catch every possible error by leaving the specified error blank, however, this is generally not a great practice because it says very little about how you were thinking.&quot;</li>

<p>Teaching tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>See if anyone can tell you the problem (it's an infinite loop).</li>
<li>Emphasize that an itty-bitty typo - just one character in this case - caused an enormous problem!</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Errors and error messages are really helpful when we've got bad syntax or are trying to access something that doesn't exist. However, not every possible programming error is able to be caught by error messages like this.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;For example, consider the code here&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Can you tell what the original intention of the code was? What went wrong? Why did the code go into an infinite loop? How can we fix this code?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;There are many errors like this where there is nothing syntactically wrong with the code, but an error in the logic, or a typo that changes the meaning of the code as we saw with the infinite loop.&quot;</li>

<h2>Infinite Infinite Loops!</h2>
<p>Most common infinite loops are a result of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>while</code> loop's condition never becomes <code>False</code>.</li>
<li>Forgetting to increment a counter variable.</li>
<li>Logic inside the loop that restarts the loop.</li>
<li>Bad logic in a <code>while</code> loop's condition (e.g., putting <code>or</code> instead of <code>and</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful to check your end conditions!</p>
<p>If you find your program running endlessly, hit <code>control-c</code> in the terminal window to stop it!</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stress that these are common, and they really have to watch out for it. Show control-c so that they're all clear on what it does. You can use this code:</li>
