<!--

## Overview
This lesson walks through the idea of modules, using the `random` module to look at documentation and methods. Then, it segues into a few longer exercises with PyTime.

## Important Notes or Prerequisites

Libraries were covered extremely briefly in the pre-work (in the Python Introduction lesson), so you can call back to that. They've also used itertools, so you can reference that. This is just a small taste of the many, many modules out there. Highly encourage students to explore more on their own!

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:

* Add packages and modules to a Python program.
* Create a program utilizing Pytime.
* Navigate library documentation.



## Duration
40 minutes.

### Notes on Timing

It would be easy to get carried away and spend a lot of time either playing around with the modules or reading through the docs. Keep an eye on the clock and move on to the next topic once you've covered a few basic examples. The goal is to understand modules, not to become a pro at any particular one.

### Use the Parking Lot!

Since there are many modules, students may start asking questions along the lines of `Hey, have you used the XXX module?` These are great questions as they reveal a lot of the student's passion and interest! Insofar as possible, try to answer those questions! If you find yourself running short of time, however, write the module name down in the parking lot so you can follow up with that student during a lab or a break.

## Suggested Agenda

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 0:00 - 0:03 | Welcome |
| 0:04 - 0:24 | Exploring Modules |
| 0:24 - 0:42 | Pytime Module |
| 0:42 - 0:45 | Summary |

## Differentiation and Extensions
- Don't let slower students be frustrated if they're hung up on a particular function. The main point is that there are other files that they can use that have functions - that's really it.
- For more advanced students, encourage them to experiment with other functions in the modules.

## In Class: Materials
- Projector
- Internet connection
- Python3

<ul>
<li><code>itertools</code>.</li>
<li>A Python function that tells us when Mother's Day is.</li>

<h2>What is a Module?</h2>
<p>Answer: They're all available to us via modules! (In fact, <code>itertools</code> IS a module).</p>
<p>Modules are collections of useful Python code and functions that we can use.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is much like a class that someone else has written.</li>
<li>It's free - less work for us!</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a function by <code>import &lt;module&gt;</code> at the top of your code, then <code>&lt;module&gt;.function_you_want()</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># import &lt; module name &gt; - brings in the module file, so we can use it.</span>
<span class="im">import</span> itertools

food <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="st">&#39;pizza&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;tacos&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;sushi&#39;</span>]
colors <span class="op">=</span> [<span class="st">&#39;red&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;green&#39;</span>]

<span class="co"># itertools.chain : &quot;Look in the itertools module, and use the chain function&quot;</span>
chained_list <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">list</span>(itertools.chain(food, colors))</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Check the Additional Reading at the end of the lesson to see how to write your own module!</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through this code - be sure they understand the import</li>
<li>Ask the students if they think module names are case sensitive</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;If you recall back to the itertools lesson, you will now see that we are using a module for that extended functionality.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;A <strong>module</strong>, according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html">Python Docs</a>, &quot;is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix <code>.py</code> appended.&quot;</p></li>
<li>You will encounter many modules that others have written. They are free-to-use and you can think of them as extensions of Python's functionality.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<section id="python-standard-library" class="level2">
<h2>Python Standard Library</h2>
<p>We're going to look at several different modules to get you used to them.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Python Standard Library</a> bundles all common modules, so we can just <code>import</code> (use) them.</p>
<p>We've seen the <code>itertools</code> module already. Let's look at another module, <code>random</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="im">import</span> random
<span class="co"># Done! Now we can use any functions in the random module!</span>

<span class="co"># randint is a function in the random module</span>
my_random_number <span class="op">=</span> random.randint(<span class="dv">2</span>,<span class="dv">8</span>)

<span class="co"># This could be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8</span>
<span class="bu">print</span>(my_random_number)</code></pre></div>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;This means that they are so commonly used, that they are already included and you don't have to download them separately.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;There are modules to help with databases, operating systems, logging, data processing, file I/O, and testing, just to name a few!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If you want to use any functions from a module in the standard library, all you need to do is include an import statement for that module at the top of your file.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Let's say we're using the random module. We import it; now, we can use the functions in it. Randint returns a random integer between two numbers we give it, including both those numbers.&quot;</li>

<li>Show the correct way to use the basic <code>randint</code> function.</li>
<li>Demonstrate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-activity: &quot;Importing the module tells your program that the module exists - there are thousands of modules, so to save space, your program will only use the ones you tell it to.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You may have noticed a NameError. That means it doesn't know what module you're referring to since it wasn't imported.&quot; different values for the randint function as a short &quot;we do&quot; activity. Show a large range and a small range.</li>

<p>How do we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>What <code>randint</code> does?</li>
<li>What the <code>random</code> module has?</li>

<p>Every module has documentation, which has:</p>
<ul>
<li>What functions are in the module.</li>
<li>How to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="_blank">documentation for the random module</a>_.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you find our <code>randint</code> function?</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walk through the documentation, though not in depth - point out the description at the top, that it tells you what module you're in, that it has the functions and brief descriptions. Reminder that they've just seen randint, so point that out.</li>
<li>End with walking through random, since that's what's next.</li>
<li>Don't go too in depth in the documentation - introduce the idea of consulting it and the basic idea, but focus on a few simple functions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&quot;So, how do we go about using the <code>random</code> module now that we know how to include it?&quot; Let's consult the documentation to get an idea of what functions are available from the random module.&quot;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the students to change the names to the people sitting around them. If you have a shy class, this gets people talking.</li>

<p>A package, also called a <strong>library</strong>, is a place where one or more related modules are stored.</p>

<li>A package is like a folder, while a module is like a file.</li>

<aside class="notes">
<strong>Talking Points</strong>: - &quot;Both <code>library</code> and <code>package</code> are technically correct and we can use the terms interchangeably.&quot; - &quot;PyTime is an interesting example of a package, because it only has one module in it&quot;

<ul>
<li>&quot;Because pytime is a package, we need to import the pytime module FROM the pytime package. It's a little confusing because they have the same name! But as you'll see in a moment, in the code itself, one is a folder name and the other is a file name.&quot;</li>

<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure they all successfully install pytime and run their file.</li>
<li>Students might get stuck on <code>pip</code> - walk around the room to be sure they've all installed pytime successfully. Consider they might need <code>python3 -m pip install pytime</code></li>
<li>Bring up a blank repl.it to show that you can test modules without needing to install them. Repl.it is great for this! (https://repl.it/<span class="citation" data-cites="SuperTernary/Empty-Replit?lite">@SuperTernary/Empty-Replit?lite</span>=true)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;If we want to use <code>pytime</code> in repl.it, it will automatically download it for us. How nice!&quot;</li>
<li>PIP3: &quot;<strong>Note</strong>: Remember <code>pip</code> stands for <code>Pip Installs Packages</code>. This helps us download and use the modules/packages we need. The <code>3</code> just makes sure we're using Python 3!&quot;</li>

<h2>PyTime Holidays</h2>
<p>Let's explore PyTime:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan the <a href="https://github.com/shinux/PyTime" target="_blank">PyTime docs</a>,_ to find the <code>mother</code> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>When is Mother's Day?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># This gets mother&#39;s day of 2016</span>
mothers_day <span class="op">=</span> pytime.mother(<span class="dv">2016</span>) <span class="co"># 2016-05-08</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What about this year?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># This gets mother&#39;s day of this year</span>
mothers_day <span class="op">=</span> pytime.mother()</code></pre></div>
<p>Try these in your file to be sure you can call PyTime functions!</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching tip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the docs with the students and pick out mother's day to explain. Encourage discussion on the docs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Let's explore the PyTime docs together.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;To start out, let's just focus on the holidays&quot;</li>
<li>After Examples: &quot;<strong>Note</strong>: It turns out that pytime defaults to the current date when there are no arguments provided.&quot;</li>
<li>Before Going to Next Slide: &quot;Looking through the documentation, we see uses of <code>father</code> and <code>easter</code> functions. They work the same way as <code>mother</code> where you may provide a <code>year</code> as an argument or let it default to the current year.&quot;</li>

<h2>Quick Review</h2>
<p>Not all modules are in the standard library. If you try to import a module Python doesn't recognize, you'll get a <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code>.</p>
<p>When importing from the standard library, the package is implied:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># (from standard) import MODULE</span>
<span class="im">import</span> random</code></pre></div>
<p>Otherwise, you need to specify the package!</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># from PACKAGE import MODULE</span>
<span class="im">from</span> pytime <span class="im">import</span> pytime
<span class="im">from</span> pygame <span class="im">import</span> joystick</code></pre></div>
<p>If you're using a non-standard package like <code>pytime</code> or <code>pygame</code>, you'll have to also install it.</p>
<p>You can use the website repl.it for testing small pieces of code - it has packages installed.</p>

<p>Look through the <a href="https://github.com/shinux/PyTime" target="_blank">PyTime docs</a>;_ can you find the <code>father</code> and <code>easter</code> functions?</p>
<p>In your local file, pick a year. In that year, print the month and day of:</p>

<h2>We Do: The Grinch Who Stole Christmas?</h2>
<p>Why does the documentation only have 3 holidays?</p>
<p>Time for some sleuthing! Most times, you only need to look at a module's documentation. However, sometimes the person that did the documenting didn't write everything down.</p>
<p>Because a module is simply a <code>.py</code> file, we can view it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up the project's <a href="https://github.com/shinux/PyTime">Github page</a>.</li>
<li>Look at the files and folders near the top of the page.</li>
<li>Click on the folder <code>pytime</code>.</li>
<li>Click on the file <code>pytime.py</code>.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <code>Festivals</code> section at the bottom of the file.</li>
<li>What function do you see which would likely give you Christmas Day?</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start a discussion here - see if students can figure out how to solve this on their own. Give reminder hints that a module is just a python file filled with functions.</li>
<li>Show examples of a couple other holidays, such as Valentine's Day</li>
<li>Be sure everyone understands what they've done here.</li>

<h2>Summary and Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>Modules are <code>.py</code> files with functions. They're written by other people for us to use!</p>
<ul>
<li>A packages (a.k.a. library) is a bundle of one or more modules.</li>
<li>Python's standard library has a lot of common modules! <code>random</code>, <code>itertools</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Nonstandard libraries need to be installed (<code>pip3 install pytime</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>To use modules, at the top of your file, put:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># From the standard library: `import MODULE`</span>
<span class="im">import</span> random

<span class="co"># From non-standard packages: `from PACKAGE import MODULE`</span>
<span class="im">from</span> pytime <span class="im">import</span> pytime
<span class="im">from</span> pygame <span class="im">import</span> joystick

<span class="co"># And preface your function with the module name.</span>
mothers_day <span class="op">=</span> pytime.mother(<span class="dv">2016</span>) <span class="co"># 2016-05-08</span></code></pre></div>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do a summary check for understanding.</li>
<li>If questions are not forthcoming, see if students can describe the random and pytime modules in their own words. Pop quiz!</li>
