<!--

## Overview
This lesson recaps what students have achieved, contextualizes that into the broader data science ecosystem, and recommends libraries and resources to further their journey.

## Learning Objectives
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Identify core libraries in the data science ecosystem, and their purpose
- Determine how to learn more about which area is most interesting to you!
- Discuss hiring in the data science job market, and strategies to support a search

## Duration
45 minutes.


## Suggested Agenda

|    Time     | Activity | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| 0:00 - 0:03 | Welcome |
| 0:03 - 0:18 | Introspection and Review |
| 0:18 - 0:43 | Establishing Yourself |
| 0:43 - 0:45 | Summary |

## Materials and Preparation:
- Give out the link to the slides.
- This lesson, more than any other in this unit, gives the instructor the ability to inject their own perspective throughout the lesson. Do not hesitate to do so!

## Differentiation and Extensions

- Add your own experience throughout the lesson.
- If you're teaching this on campus to students, feel free to add several interview prep questions towards the end.

<h2>Revisiting the data science process</h2>
<p>It's important to place our Pandas work into the broader picture of data science.</p>
<p>To do so, recall our data science workflow:</p>

<li><strong>Coding ability</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's break these down.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is just a quick overview - details on following slides.</li>

<section id="analytical-thinking" class="level2">
<h2>Analytical thinking</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>How well can you structure a data science problem / target an analysis for high impact output?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you select metrics that align with those goals?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you break a big problem into manageable, component parts?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Question:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you are a data scientist at Facebook.</li>
<li>Users list high schools they attended - some real, some fake.</li>
</ul>
<p>How could you verify that a given high school a user listed is the one they attended? How would you measure success?</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a discussion! Encourage students to suggest answers.</li>
<li>When they've finished, give the best answer.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Answer</strong>: - Referencing a full list of true high schools, and text matching against it. - Plotting the occurrence of various high school names, and assume that names that are more common (Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt) are more likely -- consider scoring against a Z-score or Normal Distribution to determine legitimacy of various names

<ul>
<li>There are 52 cards in a deck.</li>
<li>26 are red, and 26 are black. The 52 cards make up four suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs).</li>
<li>There are 13 of each suit (ace-10, jack, queen, king).</li>

<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a discussion! Encourage students to suggest answers.</li>
<li>When they've finished, give the best answer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: - What is the probability of drawing the 4 of spades or a club? <em>These two separate probabilities are 1/52 and 13/52, and they're mutually exclusive so you just add them: 5/52</em> - - What is the probability of drawing a 3 or a spade? <em>There are 4 threes and 13 spades, but one of the spades is a 3. To satisfy the 'event' described in this problem, there are 16 possible draws, out of the 52 cards; P(event 'e') = 16/52 which reduces to 4/13.</em></p>
