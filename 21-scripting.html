<!--


## Overview
This lesson starts with an explanation of a scripting language vs a compiled language, then goes on to discuss the idea of a script. The majority of the lesson is spent teaching file I/O, with just a couple slides near the end for user input.


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
* Explain the uses of scripting.
* Write scripts that perform file I/O.
* Write scripts that take user input.

## Duration
35 minutes.

### Notes on Timing

It would be easy to get carried away and spend a lot of time covering all the tiny pieces of file I/O. There are many slides that introduce terms, such as `with` or `append`, so that students won't be lost if they later find them in a tutorial online. Spend very little time here - enough to ensure the student conceptually understands the concept. They don't need to actually practice it.

<h2>What's a Scripting Language?</h2>
<p>There are only two types of programming languages in the world: <strong>scripting languages</strong> or <strong>compiled languages</strong>.</p>
<p>All languages, like Python, are one of these two categories.</p>
<p>Scripting languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>One is Python!</li>
<li>Write code, then immediate run it: <code>python my_file.py</code></li>
<li>Executes statements in order.</li>
<li>Find a bug? Fix it, run it, repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compiled languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile means &quot;build&quot;.</li>
<li><em>We can't immediate run code - the computer can't just read the code and needs to translate it to something it understands first.</em></li>
<li>Write code, <em>then compile it (not quick!),</em> then run it.</li>
<li>Find a bug? Fix it, <em>wait for the code to compile,</em> run it, repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to memorize this - just know that there's a difference, and Python is scripting.</p>
<p>What do you think a <em>script</em> is?</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not important for them to memorize what compiled is - just get the idea that it's a different kind of language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>scripting language</code> or interpreted language like Python executes statements in order</li>
<li>A <code>script</code> is typically a file with some Python code in it</li>
<li>A script might calculate something, take input, give output, or do file I/O</li>
</ul>
<p>All programming languages that exist in the world fall into one of two buckets. A <code>scripting language</code> or interpreted language like Python executes statements in order. A compiled language needs to build your program before running it.</p>
<p>Imagine; you wrote an application with Java. Before you can run it, you need to compile it - turn it After compiling completed, you run your application. When running your application, you notice a bug. To fix it, you have to stop your application, go back to source code, fix the bug, wait for the code to recompile, and restart your application to confirm that it is fixed. And if you find another bug, you’ll need to repeat that process again.</p>
<p>In a scripting language, you can fix the bug and just need to reload your application —no need to restart or recompile anymore. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Technically, you've been writing scripts already.</p>

<section id="what-is-a-script" class="level2">
<h2>What is a Script?</h2>
<p>Just some code that does something.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually written in a scripting language.</li>
<li>Can be as simple or as complex as needed!</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's write a script:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file called <code>my_script.py</code></li>
<li>Open the file in <code>Atom</code>.</li>
<li>Type the line</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;hello world!&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>

<h2>Scripting, Commonly</h2>
<p>When people say scripts, though, they usually mean code that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Takes input.</li>
<li>Gives output.</li>
<li>Reads or writes to a file.</li>
<li>Performs a task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scripting, Part 1: Files</h2>
<p>Let's further our programming toolkit.</p>
<p>On your computer, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create or open a file (text, jpg, Word doc...).</li>
<li>Read it.</li>
<li>Edit it.</li>
<li>Close it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are pretty basic actions. Can we do it in Python?</p>

<section id="we-do-lets-read-a-file" class="level2">
<h2>We Do: Let's Read a File!</h2>
<p>With files, there are three key points.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tell Python to open the file: <code>my_file = open(&lt;file name&gt;)</code></li>
<li>Do something with the file! (Read it, edit it, etc).</li>
<li>Close the file when you're done: <code>my_file.close()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>First, let's check out <strong>read</strong>: View, but not change, the contents, with <code>read()</code>.</p>
<p>Let's try. On your Desktop, create a file called &quot;hello.txt&quot; with the word &quot;hi&quot; in it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Now, also on your Desktop, create a file, <code>first_reading.py</code>. Fill it with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">my_file <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">open</span>(<span class="st">&quot;hello.txt&quot;</span>)
<span class="bu">print</span>(my_file.read())
my_file.close()</code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Run it!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: The file must exist already!</p>
<aside class="notes">

<h2>What About Editing Files?</h2>
<p>In programming, &quot;edit&quot; is referred to as &quot;write&quot;, short for &quot;write to.&quot; How do we write a file?</p>
<p><code>open(&lt;file name&gt;)</code> has optional parameters: <code>open(&lt;file name&gt;, &lt;mode&gt;)</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Mode: &quot;What do you want to do with the file?&quot; The default is &quot;read.&quot; Use <code>w</code> for &quot;write&quot;:</li>
</ul>

<h2>I Do: The With Keyword</h2>
<p>Always remembering to close a file can be hard. There's another way to open files so Python closes it for us!</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># Instead of:</span>

<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Talking Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, file I/O is associated with a lot of potential errors.</li>
<li>Sometimes if a file doesn't close properly, this can lead to:
<ul>
<li>Memory pollution on your computer</li>
<li>Keeping a file in use when it isn't</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These are bad problems! Luckily, Python has our back once again with <code>with</code>!</li>
<li><code>With</code> shortens our code, catches errors gracefully, and makes <code>close</code> unnecessary.</li>
</ul>

It's not necessary they become experts in this. Just show it to them so that they're aware if they find it in a tutorial. Here is a repl.it, if you'd like: https://repl.it/<span class="citation" data-cites="brandiw/03-Python-Scripting-03">@brandiw/03-Python-Scripting-03</span>

<h2>What about User Input?</h2>
<p>We've just done a lot with file I/O (in/out).</p>
<p>We can prompt users for information, too.</p>
<p>You've seen this a few times (remember the error checking, with the try/catch?)! It's very common.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="co"># Prompts with &quot;input&quot;</span>
<span class="co"># Saves result in user_name</span>
user_name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">input</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Please type your name:&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<aside class="notes">
<p><strong>Teaching Tips</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run this! Show this a few ways. Try type casting the input to an int.</li>
</ul>

<h2>You Do: Bring it all together!</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a file called <code>about_script.py</code>.</li>
<li>In it, prompt the user for their name. Then, prompt them for their favorite food.</li>
<li>Using write, create a file called <code>about_me.txt</code>.</li>
<li>In <code>about_me.txt</code>, write out the name and favorite food in a sentence.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Use <code>format</code> for forming your sentence!</p>
