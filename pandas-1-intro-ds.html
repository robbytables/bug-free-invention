<!--

## Overview
This lesson introduces data science and its workflow, then jumps into a workflow exercise. It includes downloading Anaconda on student machines, so they're ready for the day's content.

## Important Notes or Prerequisites
When it comes to installing Anaconda, it's important to be prepared to handle Mac v Windows across student machines. It is a good idea to delegate one IA to be the "PC person" for debugging said issues.

There are significant talking points in the slide file's comments - read through them!

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Apply the data science workflow.
- Have a set up data science development ecosystem, specific to Python


## Duration
60 minutes

## Suggested Agenda

|    Time     | Activity | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| 0:00 - 0:03 | Welcome |
| 0:03 - 0:15 | Data Science |
| 0:15 - 0:40 | Data Science Workflow |
| 0:40 - 0:57 | Data Science Development Tools |
| 0:57 - 1:00 | Summary |

## Materials and Preparation
- Send out the link to the presentation slides to students.
- Install Anaconda on your own computer.
- Consider reading GA's definitions of data science [blog post](https://theindex.generalassemb.ly/why-we-need-to-redefine-data-science-7f05ab0286d4) in advance of defining data science roles. It is also linked in resources. While going through the roles in depth is non-essential, they provide useful context for students.

## Differentiation and Extensions

- If students are excelling in the first half, consider accelerating the flow or introducing your own (more complex) data science workflow problem, like breaking down (at a high level) the Netflix recommendation algorithm.
- If students are struggling, emphasize that many of the topics discussed will be reintroduced throughout the day's exercises. Lean on real world examples!

## In Class: Materials
- Projector
- Internet connection
- Python3
- Anaconda

<h2>Data Science Definition</h2>
<p>Compliments of GA's Standard Board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data science is the practice of: acquiring, organizing, and delivering complex data; discovering relationships and anomalies among variables; building and deploying machine learning models; and synthesizing data to influence decision-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Data scientists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use data of all kinds (numbers, text, images).</li>
<li>Make explanations and predictive decisions.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching Tips: - This is a mouthful! Summarize it; don't read it!</p>
Talking Points: - Define data science and associated roles. - Explain predictive decisions are broadly leveraging data about prior events to inform future strategy - Encourage the class to participate and throw out examples of data science in the real world. The more comfortable the class feels making guesses and making the content relatable to their life at this point, the more engaged they will be throughout the lesson.

<h2>The Data Science Workflow</h2>
<figure>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ga-instruction/assets/python-fundamentals/Data-Framework-White-BG.png" />
</figure>
<p><strong>Class Discussion:</strong> Which step do you believe will be most challenging?</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no objectively correct answer!</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw the workflow on the board to reference.</li>
<li>Keep the example dataset open in a new tab.</li>
<li>Focus on the importance of defining a question, especially following the first class discussion of which workflow component is most challenging</li>
<li>Consider thinking through your own work, and anchoring the discussion of the workflow steps against that example to reduce abstraction</li>
<li>Make the step-by-step exercise engaging at every component. Let the class guide the problem you want to solve. If you'd like, you can encourage them to converge on a single problem statement you feel most comfortable with discussing (like those below)</li>
<li>You may consider running the whole exercise as unstructured time, or guiding step-by-step. Step-by-step is recommended to assure learners remain on task and do not get stuck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking Points:</p>
<ul>
<li>While the data science workflow is presented as five sequential steps, reinforce data science is often recursive among these areas. When an analysis yields an unexpected result, you may revisit the preparation of data to assure the steps were handled properly.</li>
<li>Defining a question and tying work against an objective is essential to emphasis because problems that progress without a hypothesis to prove or disprove ultimately become circular. There are a near infinite number of spurious correlations or &quot;interesting&quot; ideas to consider. Only those that further drive you towards on outcome are necessary.</li>
<li><p>There are caveats to this process. Note the area labeled &quot;<em>these steps are not hard-set rules.</em>&quot;</p></li>
<li><strong>Frame:</strong> Assure students first, identify what factors affect cost. Then, consider how those costs can be reduced. Finally, hypothesize a way to describe or predict if those given factors can be reduced.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Encourage learners to consider data integrity. A few easy points to call out: differing ways of reporting &quot;No&quot; (<code>N</code> and <code>No</code>) and missing values (<code>NA</code>). Reassure students that it is quite common to have datasets where the ground truth answers to questions like these are unknown.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Reinforce the importance of data preparation and connecting analyses to the initial question with analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Interpret:</strong> Restate the hypothesis you are aiming to prove or disprove. Identify if the limited dataset provides you with anecdotes to validate or invalidate that statement.</li>
<li><p><strong>Communicate:</strong> Provide your best communications tips, written and verbal alike. These persist when using data.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="notes-on-the-steps" class="level2">
<h2>Notes on the Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not hard-set rules.</li>
<li>Really, problem-solving guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every problem's different!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some projects may not require every step.</p></li>
<li><p>It's normal to repeat certain steps a few times.</p></li>
<li><p>The process is cyclical with new findings!</p></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking points:</p>
<p>A recommended problem is like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame:</strong> Let's presume the key cost driver for this HR function is twofold: employees turning over early (low total years of service) and a high time to fill (positions going unfilled, costing producitivity losses). We'll aim to minimize turnover. Let's hypothesize we can explain how long an employee stays with the company based on their university, previous employment, and how they found our retail store, Data Science Wearables (DSW).</li>
<li><strong>Prepare:</strong> We would want to create a consistent data standard for <code>Current Employee</code> -&gt; <code>No</code> to <code>N</code> across the dataset. Moreover, we need to hypothesize why <code>NA</code> values exist. E.g. did the second candidate not have a previous employer, or was this data unavailable? (We do not know with the information given.)</li>
<li><strong>Analyze:</strong> While we will dive deeper into analysis using Python soon enough, anecdotal evidence based on three observations seems to imply that Candidate Source is a useful explanatory variable. Employees that had experience with DSW previously (<code>Internship</code> and <code>Referral</code>) stayed longer. The relationship between waiting to fill (<code>Time to Fill (Days)</code>) and employee tenure may make a U-shape: an employee either previously knows of DSW (short time to fill) and stays for a while because they liked it or DSW waited for the perfect candidate (long time to fill) and stayed for a while. School does not seem to have useful signal for employee tenure.</li>
<li><strong>Interpret:</strong> It appears many of our explanatory factors helped, but not all, and not in ways we may have anticipated. <code>School</code> does not seem to yield valuable insight, but knowing an employee has been referred or had experience with DSW previously is a key signal. Perhaps DSW should expand their internship and employee referral programs.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate:</strong> Our driving thesis is: The best candidates for DSW are those that have connected with the store in a previous way (internship, referral). Investing in these programs is recommended. Visualizations of average employee tenure segmented by these factors are encouraged.</li>

<h2>Step 1 is Always &quot;Frame the Problem&quot;</h2>
<p>Solving data science task starts with a clearly defined problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor results stem from no defined goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“A problem well stated is half solved.”</em> — Charles Kettering</p>
<p>From there, you can apply your steps.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even though all data science projects have different general flows, they start in the same place: with a problem. From this problem statement arises questions; questions we will ask the data in order to gain more information so we can attempt to find a solution to that problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Let's restate that: <strong>solving data science task starts with a clearly defined problem.</strong> Too often, situations will lack a driving objective. Haplessly exploring data without a determined goal produces poor results.</p></li>

<li><p>Results may be only as convincing as they are conveyed to key stakeholders. The process of communication requires honing a cohesive narrative that establishes a thesis and includes evidence to back up said statement. Backing up the statement includes statistical tests, visualizations, and model results.</p></li>
<li>The best practices you may have heard in prior written and verbal exercises equally apply to communicating with data. Rather than viewing data as a separate entity altogether (&quot;I'm not a data person&quot;), consider how data can aid your existing thesis.</li>

<h2>Why Python for Data Science</h2>
<p>Easy to write</p>
<ul>
<li>Data science is inherently a cross-functional discipline!</li>
<li>A language for all audiences is key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open source</p>
<ul>
<li>New techniques become available daily!</li>
<li>Developers from around the world race to implement new libraries.</li>
<li>This places Python in contrast to closed source, paid data analysis tools like SAS and SPSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often used for data analysis, scripting, and rapid software development.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the first portion of this week, you've focused on learning the fundamentals of Python. Why do we (and the community) emphasize Python as a choice language for data science?</p></li>
<li><p>For starters, let's return to a buzzword-heavy and unofficial Python definition</p></li>
<li><p>Let's break down these definitional attributes and discuss their impact on Python being a common language for data:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High level:</strong> Python is <em>&quot;far from&quot;</em> our computer's RAM and CPU, meaning it is less like binary (<code>01101010</code>) and closer to plaintext English. This makes Python comparatively more intuitive as a first language. Because data science is inherently a cross-functional discipline, allowing it to be picked up by all audiences is key.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open source:</strong> Python's source code is free to use, and anyone can contribute to improve it. Being an open source language is a huge reason Python is a choice language for data science. As new techniques become available daily, developers from around the world race to implement said methods in Python libraries. (This places Python in contrast to closed source, paid data analysis tools like SAS and SPSS.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Object-oriented:</strong> You learned how to create objects and classes for reproducible use cases. Object-oriented languages are generally more familiar for introductory content, lending a helping hand to Python being approachable.</p></li>

<h2>You Do: Your Data Science Development Tools</h2>
<p>Python packages in DS are ubiquitous: - Reading CSVs, linear algebra, linear regressions, matrices...</p>
<p><strong>Anaconda</strong> (&quot;Conda&quot;): - Package manager. - Downloads everything for us!</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Download <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a>: <code>https://www.anaconda.com/download/</code>. Select Python 3.6+ for your machine (macOS or PC)</p></li>
<li><p>Open the file. Follow the on-screen prompts. Don't hesitate to ask questions!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Please wait once you have successfully installed Anaconda.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Teaching Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasize that Python has <em>packages</em> as the reason why we see it being a choice language for data science. Connect that packages are the result of Python being an open source technology.</li>
<li>Work with your IAs to debug and assist students as complications (inevitably) pop up. Be sure everyone can successfully explain why we use packages, install Anaconda, and open a Jupyter Notebook.</li>
<li>With the Notebook, go <strong>step-by-step</strong> with all students. Do not encourage them to skip ahead of where you want them to be. (e.g. when they finish download, clearly tell them when to click through all install instructions. Stop and wait for further instruction.)</li>
<li>Delegate one IA to be the Windows or Mac person, and you take the other. Typically, Macs are more represented in these classes, so it makes most sense for the instructor to be the lead on Mac, and a IA to be the Windows person.</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Notice that when we use Python for data science, we are heavily relying on a open source packages. Python packages are Python scripts that allow us to easily performance reproducible actions.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, when we in data to analyze, we could handle input/output functions, parsing lines of a CSV, and correctly storing datatypes in memory. Or, we could (and will) use Pandas to simply say <code>pd.read_csv(data.csv)</code> to handle all of that work with a single line of code.</p></li>
<li><p>Python libraries are collections of packages. We may install a library for linear algebra or separately a library for linear regressions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, the question becomes: <strong>how do we install all of the necessary Python packages?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anaconda</strong> is a product that solves many of the headaches associated with Python packaging.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anaconda (maintained by Anaconda, Inc. and sometimes just called &quot;Conda&quot;) is a Python package manager.</li>
<li>It comes with many of the required tools and products we need to begin doing data science in Python.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Download <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a>:</strong> Select Python 3.6+ for your machine (macOS or PC)</p>
Please: open the file once it finishes downloading, and proceed with the on-screen prompts. There is no need to deviate from the default installation. (If you believe you have a question for your instructor based on your machine, please do not hesitate to raise your hand.)

<h2>You Do: Launching Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use your computer's program search method (Spotlight on Mac) to search &quot;Anaconda Navigator&quot;.</li>
<li>Open Anaconda Navigator</li>
<li>Click &quot;Launch&quot; on Jupyter Notebooks.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>wait...</em></p>
<p>It opens in your browser!</p>
<p>You have a Jupyter Notebook!</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development environments between Mac and Windows differ, and there are many ways to open Jupyter Notebooks. (Just like there are many ways to open any given file or program on your computer!)</li>
<li>Emphasize that data science is not all about just writing code. (Hardly!) Discuss the importance of justifying methods. The text included in the lesson provides one example of this (mean vs median), copied here. Consider discussing your own experiences here as well.</li>
<li>The methods we're applying -- which are typically far more subjective or indeterministic in contrast to straight software development -- are the other half. For example, pretend we're missing many values. Do you fill in missing values with the mean or the median? The code for doing either of these operations is far less significant than the justifying decision. Jupyter Notebooks make it easy to create code cells next to text cells.</li>
<li>When it comes to markdown, tell students that no one spends time memorizing markdown syntax. Rather, we reference the markdown cheatsheet to remember how to make large headers, bulleted lists, tables, and more. An apt analogy is a mechanic does not spend time memorizing the pantones of cars, but when he/she needs to do a paint job, they will look up the necessary color codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teaching Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a Jupyter Notebook with students (using the Anaconda Navigator), explain code and markdown cells, and create examples of each.- Be patient with students as they launch their first Jupyter Notebook, and be cognizant of the differences in Mac vs Windows for this exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Go slowly</strong> when creating and filling in code cells and markdown cells</li>

</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Talking points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data science is both code and methods:</strong> As data scientists, the code we write is only half the story. The methods we're applying -- which are typically far more subjective or indeterministic in contrast to straight software development -- are the other half. For example, pretend we're missing many values. Do you fill in missing values with the mean or the median? The code for doing either of these operations is far less significant than the justifying decision. Jupyter Notebooks make it easy to create code cells next to text cells.</li>
<li><strong>Connect to remote computing resources:</strong> While we will not be doing this in a today's content, Jupyter Notebooks make it easy to connect to remote computers (datacenters). This is why the Jupyter Notebook is in your browser. You've created a <code>localhost</code> server -- a website for one person: you. The brains for this operation are your computer. We could in swap the brains from your computer for stronger computers in a data center, but still write code in your own browser. Wow!</li>
